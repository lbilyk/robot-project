**Robot-Project**
Code for the Fall 2018 embedded controller project meant to create a robot that can be controlled through a website/phone app. 
The Raspberry Pi hosts a web server for all interactions and forwards these through rs232 to a microcontroller board with a nucleo board attached. 
The attached nucleo board runs all other code for physical movements and interactions as they are recieved from the Raspberry Pi.

Created and coded by: Lyubomyr Bilyk and Nik Kershaw
